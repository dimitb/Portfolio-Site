# Portfolio-Site

This Portfolio Website is the second project in the Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree program that displays a simple website coded and run through HTML & CSS. The site shows my latest or featured work below a large responsive hero image displaying the ninja theme of the site.

# Getting Started

As this is an HTML coded site, it will display on all browsers, though not all items may display properly on older displays (I have strived for compatibility with as many browsers as possible). In order to view the site, simply download a copy of the HTML file along with the folders containing the Javascript, CSS, and image files to your local computer.

Once downloaded, doubleclick to open the "portfolio-site.html" file and a new browser tab or window will open displaying the site in your browser.
